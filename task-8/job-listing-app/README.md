🔐 Next.js + TypeScript Authentication — Task 8
This is an authentication system built with Next.js, TypeScript, and NextAuth.js, using both custom credentials and Google OAuth for a Job-listing application. In this task, we implemented user sign-up and sign-in functionality and connected it to the provided backend API endpoints for real user authentication.

✅ Features
🔑 User Sign In & Sign Up — Custom pages for user registration and login.

🛂 NextAuth Integration — Secure authentication with Credentials & Google providers.

🧾 JWT & Session Handling — Manages secure session and token-based auth flow.

🌐 API Integration — Fully integrated with the backend for real-time auth.

⚠️ Error Handling — Graceful handling of invalid credentials or failed API requests.
